> * It will be a natural flow with a big hero image at the top to create interest, below that the Menu followed by a Gallery, Book a table and last contact.
> * Only short and relevant information in form of text throughout the website to not distract the customer.

- ### Skeleton

> * Roboto is used as font, an easy to read and very common font for websites.
> * A cursive Akaya Telivigala is used for title/name of the restaurant to stand out.  
> * The order of the content is based on what i think is expected from a website like this.
