## Description

> This is my second Milestone Project at Code Institute. In this project I will create an interactive website with HTML5, CSS and Javascript.

> Pasta Palace is a restaurant with the goal to reach out to the local community to showcase their menu and to add the possibility for customers to book a table or order food for take away. This is reached with a neat design with only relevant features and intuitive interactivity to get a clear and good user experience.

## Business Goals

> To reach more potential customers in the area of Stockholm with our products and services to book a table, order take away food and look into our menu with a clean, responsive and intuitive way for a good user experience and willingness to buy and visit the restaurant.

### Strategy

> To align with the Business goals potential customer research has been done to answer some questions:

> - What do you most use this kind of website for?
> - What do you do before/after using this kind of website?
> - What makes a good experience?
> - What do you expect when visiting this kind of website?

> The result from this research is a website with only a few key functions to accomplish what the customers are looking for. A simple, not so busy site with clear steps to take to do what we want.

### Scope

> Features in scope for the first release:
>
> - Navigation Scroll to function.
> - Interactive Menu to view only the section of your choice (Starter, Main courses, Dessert, Drinks).
> - Add to cart function for the menu.
> - Showcase a Gallery of images in a slide show.
> - Book a table function generating an email to the restaurant.
> - EmailJS function to the contact form.
> - Modal showing when contact form is filled out and sent.
> - Modal showing when book a table form is filled out and sent.
> - Modal showing when Purchase is clicked.
> - Alert are shown when trying to add same item to cart more than once.
> - Alert shown when trying to book a table without filling in all inputs.
> - Alert shown when trying to send the contact form without filling in all inputs.
> - A 404 page that redirect user back to index.html without having to use the browser navigation buttons.

> Features out of scope for the first release:
>
> - The possibility to actually make the purchase from the basket.
> - Add information about purchase, how long it will take and real time update.
> - The possibility to see available slots to book a table function in real time.

### Structure

> - All interactions will only happen on intuitive and on user action with a clear feedback what is happening.
> - It will be a natural flow with a big hero image at the top to create interest, below that the Menu followed by a Gallery, Book a table and last contact.
> - Only short and relevant information in form of text throughout the website to not distract the customer.

### Skeleton

> - A big navigation bar will be visible on top of the page all the time, even when scrolling.
> - All content will be on the main page.
> - Some content will only be visible upon user actions to make the site less busy and only showing what the user decide to show to create a neat and smooth experience.

### Surface

> - A light color scheme is be used throughout the website as background and darker colors for the text and content. Background color for the entire site is: #f0f0f0.
> - Roboto is used as font, an easy to read and very common font for websites.
> - A cursive Akaya Telivigala is used for title/name of the restaurant to stand out.
> - The order of the content is based on what i think is expected from a website like this.

### Bugs found and fixed during development:

> - scrollIntoView function scrolled too far due fixed navbar. Fixed by creating a div above the section to scroll to instead.
> - When changing menu from starters it wasn't possible to add the new items to cart. Solved by calling the ready function after changing menu.
> - Alert displayed when forms not filled in stayed without getting removed. First fixed by setting a onKeyDown function to remove the alert. Later fixed with setTimeout function to 2.5 sec.
> - onKeyDown error in console in index.html for the contact form. onKeyDown function calling was still in the form in index.html even if the function was replaced by setTimeout function. Fixed by removing onKeyDown from index.html contact form.
> - Label had the same name in two places. Fixed by changing one of them to get accessibility score to 100.
> - Sometimes when trying to add items to cart twice you are too far scrolled down to see the alert. This issue was fixed to always scrollIntoView to the alert when this happens.
> - On mobile size screens its easy to be to far scrolled down on the page to see the alerts when not filling out the forms correctly. This was fixed to scrollIntoView to alert section when this happens. This only applies to screens with max-width of 570px.
> - On Tablet size one item in Drinks menu is centralized instead of aligning with the rest of the items. This bug is left unfixed.
> - Social media links takes you to main page of social media platform. This is because the restaurant is not real and have no social media.
> - Bad performance result while testing the site performance. Tried multiple things to try to fix this. Make images smaller, compress images and gzip compression.

### Browser compatibility

> - Safari:
>
> 1. The hero image and contact image stretched out in Safari. After some research it seems to be a bug in Safari that caused the issue. I needed to add !important to hero image height and align-items: flex-start; to contact image to fix the problem in Safari.
> 2. ScrollIntoView function in Safari isn't scrolling, its jumping directly to the section instead of a soft scrolling. Otherwise everything works as expected according to the test of user stories.

> - Google Chrome: Nothing to address, works according to test of user stories.

> - Mozilla Firefox:

> 1. Not the same smooth scrolling when using the nav-tabs to scroll to section as in Google Chrome and as intended.

> - Microsoft Edge: Nothing to address, works according to test of user stories.

### Functional tests on different devices

> - Iphone 7, Iphone 11 Pro, Iphone SE, Ipad. Samsung Galaxy S10e, Xiaomi Mi Note 10. Laptop, PC. Below tests was performed on all devices:
>
> 1. All Navigation links were tested to see if they work as intended including the collapsed navbar on phones.
> 2. All Menu tabs were clicked to test if the new content show.
> 3. All Menu items were clicked twice to check that it gets added to cart and on second click that the alert is shown.
> 4. Remove button and change quantity on items in the cart was tested.
> 5. Total amount in cart checked so it gets updated accordingly.
> 6. Check that image slider shows the images and that next/prev button works as intended
> 7. Checked that date picker in book a table section works.
> 8. Checked that correct alert shown when book button is i clicked when something in the book a table form isn't filled out or email filled out with wrong format.
> 9. Checked that modal shown with correct information when book a table form is filled out correctly and button Book is clicked.

> 15. Enter wrong path when trying to enter the website to check if the 404 page is working and that button there takes the user back to index.html.
